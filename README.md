# cisco  - Enterprise Data Center Fabric - Spine-Leaf Archite...

## Overview
This repository contains network configuration files generated by [Intent-ify](https://intent-ify.com) for implementing "Enterprise Data Center Fabric - Spine-Leaf Architecture

Hardware Stack (14 devices):
- 4x Cisco Nexus 9364C spine switches
- 8x Nexus 9348GC-FXP leaf switches  
- 2x ASR 1006-X border routers

Design Requirements:
✓ VXLAN overlay with BGP EVPN control plane
✓ OSPF underlay for IP reachability
✓ 100G spine-leaf connectivity (ECMP load balancing)
✓ Multi-tenant VRF isolation per business unit

Network Segmentation:
- Production Apps (VNI 10010): 10.100.10.0/24
- Database Tier (VNI 10020): 10.100.20.0/24
- Dev/Test (VNI 10030): 10.100.30.0/24  
- Storage iSCSI (VNI 10040): 10.100.40.0/24

Advanced Features:
→ Anycast gateway for VM mobility across fabric
→ BFD for sub-second convergence
→ Micro-segmentation: DB tier isolated, app-only access on specific ports
→ Border routers: BGP peering to corporate WAN + internet" on cisco  devices.

- **Configuration File**: `configs/cisco--config.txt`
- **Security Score**: 95/100
- **Configuration Type**: cisco

## Security Notice
⚠️ **Important**: Review all configuration commands before applying to production systems. Always test in a lab environment first.

## Implementation Guide

### Prerequisites
- Access to cisco  device
- Administrative privileges
- Basic understanding of cisco CLI/configuration syntax

### Deployment Steps

1. **Review Configuration**
   - Open `configs/cisco--config.txt`
   - Review all configuration commands
   - Verify settings match your network requirements

2. **Backup Current Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Always backup before making changes
   show running-config > backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).txt
   ```

3. **Apply Configuration**
   - Copy configuration commands from the file
   - Apply them to your device via CLI or configuration management tool
   - Test functionality after each major section

4. **Verification**
   - Verify configuration is working as expected
   - Run relevant show commands to confirm status
   - Test connectivity and functionality
